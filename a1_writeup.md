# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?

I think it's ok and honestly better than the other programming languages I used. I learned what Python has that other programming languages don't have.

2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?

Python is a stricter programming language than other languages such as JavaScript and HTML, where some stuff is not allowed such as switching variable types. However, the basics of the language is still easier whereas you don't have to put anything before a variable name when you are defining a variable, and the language automatically interprets what type of variable you want to define.

3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?

I learned how to make functions and I also learned to go over my program to see what went wrong.
